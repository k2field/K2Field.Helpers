=====================
So what's this then?
=====================

It is a fork of the code for [Adam Castle's k2 underground helper project](http://www.k2underground.com/groups/k2_code_helper/default.aspx). Unfortunately Adam and myself both made changes from an early version, so it is difficult to merge it back. This version is used extensively with the github version of the [Workflow tester utility](https://github.com/k2workflow/K2Field.Utilities.WF.UnitTesting).

=======================
What's new in this one?
=======================

bug fixes and the ability to target activity data fields. Plus a few other bits that I've fogotten about but were needed for enhancements to the WF testing tool.
